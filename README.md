# gatsby-everywhere
The first of my practice works using gatsby.

### Prerequisites
-    Node.js (v18 or newer)
-    Git
-    Gatsby command line interface (CLI) (v5 or newer)
-    Visual Studio Code (or any editer you want)

### Getting Started

- To Start install gatsby-cli through npm & run
```shell
gatsby new
```
- Then go through the setup wizard according to your wishes & run
```shell
cd "your-site"
```
- To start the development server, run
```shell
gatsby develop
```

- You can now view "your-site" in the browser.
â €
  http://localhost:8000/
â €
- View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and
schema
â €
  http://localhost:8000/___graphql
